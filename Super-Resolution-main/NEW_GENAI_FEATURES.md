- Multiple enhancement variants with intelligent scoring
- Comprehensive face analysis and pose detection
- Advanced upscaling and enhancement techniques

## 🛠️ New Features

### 🎯 **Advanced Face Detection**
- **DNN-based detection** - Uses OpenCV's deep neural network models
- **Haar cascade fallback** - Automatic fallback if DNN fails
- **Multiple detection methods** - Ensures faces are found

### 👤 **Face Pose Analysis**
- **Head pose estimation** - Measures yaw, pitch, roll angles
- **Eye aspect ratio** - Detects blinking and eye openness
- **Front-facing detection** - Identifies optimal face orientation
- **Quality metrics** - Calculates image clarity and sharpness

### 🔄 **Multiple Enhancement Variants**
1. **Light Enhancement** - Subtle improvements
2. **Medium Enhancement** - Balanced processing with skin smoothing
3. **Strong Enhancement** - Advanced processing with upscaling
4. **Maximum Enhancement** - Full processing pipeline

### 📊 **Intelligent Scoring System**
- **Quality scores** - Based on image sharpness and clarity
- **Similarity scores** - Maintains facial identity
- **Combined scores** - Weighted combination for best results
- **Automatic recommendation** - Suggests the best variant

### 🖼️ **Advanced Processing**
- **Skin smoothing** - Targeted face region enhancement
- **Bilateral filtering** - Noise reduction while preserving edges
- **Unsharp masking** - Intelligent sharpening
- **CLAHE enhancement** - Contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization
- **High-quality upscaling** - LANCZOS resampling

## 🎮 How to Use

1. **Upload your image** as usual
2. **Choose enhancement method**:
   - **"Enhance Image"** - Original method (unchanged)
   - **"Enhance with GENAI"** - New AI method (multiple variants)
3. **View results** - GenAI shows 4 different enhancement levels
4. **Download preferred result** - Choose the variant you like best

## 🔧 Technical Details

### **Model Downloads**
- **Face detection models** - OpenCV DNN models
- **Dlib landmarks** - 68-point face landmark detection
- **Automatic setup** - Models download on first use

### **Processing Pipeline**
1. **Face detection** - Locate faces in the image
2. **Pose analysis** - Analyze face orientation and quality
3. **Enhancement variants** - Generate multiple processed versions
4. **Quality assessment** - Score each variant
5. **Recommendation** - Select best result

### **Compatibility**
- **Flask app unchanged** - Same API interface maintained
- **Existing functionality** - Regular enhance button works as before
- **New capabilities** - GenAI button provides advanced features

## 🧪 Testing

Run the test script to verify everything works:

```bash
python test_new_genai.py
```

This will:
- Test compatibility with Flask app
- Verify the enhancement pipeline
- Generate sample results
- Confirm all features work correctly

## 📈 Benefits

### **For Users**
- **More enhancement options** - Choose from multiple variants
